Hey there! I'm Paula :)

I've been working as a frontend developer for the past 12 years. I witnessed the jQuery/AngularJS frenzy and OOCSS, and I've experienced the loss of Google Reader, Geocities, and Orkut, as well as the rise of ReactJS.

I fell in love with the Web in the late 90s, browsing through shrines, blogs, Altavista, CadÃª (for my Brazilian friends), and Yahoo Games. I dabbled with Microsoft FrontPage, built a website about anime, hosted it on Geocities, and decided that I wanted to work on building websites when I was only 14. However, that wasn't a common career path in Brazil at the time, so like most things, it was just a dream for a poor kid. It's incredible to think that 20 years later, I have had the opportunity to create web experiences for companies like Vimeo, Planned Parenthood, and Epic Games.
